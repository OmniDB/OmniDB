# OmniDB 2.0.1

OmniDB was completely rewritten to Python using the Django framework. Starting from version `2.0`, **OmniDB Python version** will receive new features and will be actively maintained.

The source code for the ASP.NET/C\# version is in the branch **csharp**. The next release of OmniDB C\# version is `1.7`, and it will only receive bug fixes.

Besides being written in Python, initial version of `OmniDB 2.0` contains the following main differences from the C\# version:

- Support to HTTPS;
- It allows query execution in background and cancellation through the use of *websockets*;
- Initially, only an improved support of PostgreSQL is implemented. More RDBMS support coming soon;
- There is a new `Snippet` feature.
