# Paramiko Expect
#
# Written by Fotis Gimian
# http://github.com/fgimian
#
# This library works with a Paramiko SSH channel to provide native SSH
# expect-like handling for servers.  The library may be used to interact
# with commands like 'configure' or Cisco IOS devices or with interactive
# Unix scripts or commands.
#
# You must have Paramiko installed in order to use this library.
